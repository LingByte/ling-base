// Checkpoint is the engine-agnostic persistence record produced at a
// safe boundary during execution. Each engine decides what its own
// step marker / payload looks like; this struct only owns the common
// envelope shape.
//
// Engines populate Checkpoint and hand it to [Checkpointer.Checkpoint]
// (the host method). The host is responsible for writing it durably;
// engines must not assume the call has persisted anything.
type Checkpoint struct {
	// ExecID identifies the engine execution this checkpoint belongs
	// to. MUST equal the producing [Run.RunID].
	ExecID string `json:"exec_id"`

	// Steps is an opaque, engine-defined marker set locating "where"
	// the run is. For graph it is the most recently completed wave —
	// the resume anchor (the frontier is rebuilt from it) and the
	// "paused at" display (last element). A single-node wave degrades
	// to a one-element slice; empty means "no position recorded".
	// The host treats these as opaque strings.
	Steps []string `json:"steps,omitempty"`

	// Iteration is an optional monotonic counter for engines that
	// loop (graph re-entry counter, scheduler tick, …). Zero is fine
	// when the engine doesn't track iterations.
	Iteration int `json:"iteration,omitempty"`

	// Board is the Board state at the boundary. Always non-nil.
	Board *BoardSnapshot `json:"board"`

	// Payload is engine-specific extra state the engine wants to
	// persist alongside the Board. Treated as opaque JSON by the
	// store; the producing engine is the only consumer that knows
	// how to decode it.
	Payload json.RawMessage `json:"payload,omitempty"`

	// Attributes mirrors [Run.Attributes] at the time the checkpoint
	// was produced (run id at the agent layer, tenant, graph id, …).
	// Stores may use these for indexing/lookup.
	Attributes map[string]string `json:"attributes,omitempty"`

	// Timestamp is the wall-clock time the engine produced the
	// checkpoint. Hosts may overwrite when they actually persist.
	Timestamp time.Time `json:"timestamp"`

	// OriginalStartedAt is the wall-clock time the original (fresh)
	// run started. Stays constant across resumes so dashboards
	// computing total wall time (e.g. SLO budget burn) don't reset
	// every time a host re-loads the checkpoint and resumes.
	//
	// Engines SHOULD copy this from [ResumeContext.StartedAt] (when
	// resuming) or from the time they began the fresh run (when
	// producing the first checkpoint). Hosts driving resume via
	// [LoadAndResume] thread the value through automatically — the
	// helper reads OriginalStartedAt off the loaded checkpoint and
	// stamps it back on the next ResumeContext.
	//
	// Zero time means "not recorded" (engines that ship before this
	// field was added, or that don't track wall time). Consumers
	// should fall back to Timestamp in that case.
	OriginalStartedAt time.Time `json:"original_started_at,omitzero"`

	// SpecVersion identifies the engine's spec / definition version
	// at the time the checkpoint was produced. The format is
	// engine-defined: graph runner uses the graph definition's
	// Version (falling back to its Name when Version is empty); a
	// script engine could store a content hash; a host application
	// could compose a spec document version.
	//
	// CanResume implementations compare this against the engine's
	// current version: a mismatch means the underlying spec has
	// drifted (graph re-edited, script reloaded, application spec
	// reapplied with a new agent definition) and silently resuming
	// would replay against semantics the original run never saw.
	// Engines that detect drift surface errdefs.NotAvailable from
	// CanResume so the host can either fall back to a fresh run or
	// surface the mismatch to the operator.
	//
	// Empty means "no version recorded" — older checkpoints, or
	// engines that have no concept of versioned spec. CanResume
	// MUST treat empty as "skip drift check" rather than "always
	// fail" so old checkpoints stay loadable.
	SpecVersion string `json:"spec_version,omitempty"`
}

// Validate checks the envelope invariants every engine and every
// durable store can rely on. Engine-specific fields (Steps,

// the engine's own [Resumer] implementation so engines can keep

// Save calls for the same exec id overlap, the later call wins. The

// returned checkpoint must not affect the store or other Load
