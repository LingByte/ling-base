// Self-test for HostSuite: NoopHost is the canonical zero-value
// host implementation, so it should pass every contract subtest
// out of the box. If THIS test ever fails, either NoopHost has
// regressed (unlikely — three lines per method) or the suite has
// acquired a bug that would also flag legitimate third-party
// hosts.
