// Package sandbox is the agent's execution boundary: where commands run,
// what they can reach (net), what they can see (env), and how much they
// can consume (resources). Sandbox is daemon-level shared policy; per-run
// state lives in core/workspace.
//
// The package centres on the [Runner] interface: a process session
// manager, with the one-shot [Exec] as a derived view over Start.
// Concrete runners differ in *where* the work happens (local process,
// bubblewrap namespace, container, microVM) but share the same policy
// surface so a caller can be retargeted between backends without
// changing call sites. Every Runner declares [Capabilities] up front —
// policy enforcement and session features — and every started [Session]
// declares its own [SessionCapabilities], so tools never discover
// abilities through interface assertions. Lifecycle is part of the
// contract too: every Runner implements Close, which terminates active
// sessions and releases backend-owned resources, and the decorators
// forward it so wrapping never hides the backend's cleanup.
//
// ExecOptions carries three policy groups beyond the obvious WorkDir /
// Stdin / Timeout knobs:
//
//   - Env (EnvPolicy): explicit allow-list of host environment variables
//     plus an Inject map. Replaces "inherit the entire daemon's env" which
//     is unsafe in a multi-tenant agent harness.
//   - Net (NetPolicy): mode + (future) allow-list / proxy URL. The local
//     only accepts NetDefault; non-default modes require a sandboxing
//     backend (namespace-based, container-based, or microVM-based) that
//     can actually enforce the policy at the kernel level.
//   - Resources (ResourceLimits): CPU / memory / disk caps plus
//     MaxOutputBytes. On unix, sandbox/local enforces group-wide memory
//     and cpu-time caps with a sampling watcher and kills the whole
//     process group on overflow. DiskBytes still needs a quota-capable
//     backend and is rejected with errdefs.NotAvailable.
//
// Runner.Capabilities lets callers inspect the honest policy surface
// before execution. sandbox/local reports env + process-group resource
// enforcement but not filesystem or network confinement. Concrete
// backends backends add those OS-level boundaries:
//
//	                             local     seatbelt/macOS  bubblewrap/Linux
//	Env allow-list                yes           yes             yes
//	Filesystem write bounds        no           yes             yes
//	NetDenyAll                     no           yes             yes
//	MemoryBytes                   yes           yes             yes
//	CPUMillicores                 yes           yes             yes
//	DiskBytes                      no            no              no
//
// WithDefaults fixes daemon-owned policy, AllowCommands adds a hard
// command-name gate, and WithApproval adds a fail-closed human decision
// tripwire. The recommended local composition lives in
// core/sandbox.ComposeLocal.
//
// # Sessions and Exec
//
// Every Runner is a process session manager: Start spawns interactive
// or streaming processes under the same ExecOptions policy, and the
// one-shot Exec is a derived view over Start. Policy is fixed once at
// Start — env, network posture, resource caps, and approval are never
// re-negotiated per Read/Write. Output is a byte-cursor log:
// Read(afterSeq) replays from any retained position, bounded by
// Resources.MaxOutputBytes, so a reconnecting client resumes without
// re-running the process. The decorators forward Start as well, so
// interactive sessions cannot bypass the defaults / approval /
// allow-list chain. Signal / Watch / Resize are part of the Session
// interface itself; unsupported operations return
// errdefs.NotAvailable rather than failing at discovery time.
