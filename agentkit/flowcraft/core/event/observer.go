// Observer is the bus-level instrumentation hook. It carries the
// OnPublish / OnDeliver / OnDrop lifecycle for every envelope, giving
// callers a single place to wire metrics / tracing / drop accounting.
//
// Concurrency contract — every Bus implementation must guarantee:
//
//   - Observer methods are invoked outside any bus-internal lock.
//   - Implementations must return promptly. They MUST NOT call back into
//     Bus methods (Publish / Subscribe / Close); doing so risks deadlock
//     and the bus is allowed to detect such calls and panic in debug
//     builds.
//   - Observer methods may be invoked concurrently from multiple
//     goroutines; implementations must be safe for concurrent use.
//
// Ordering:
//
//   - For a single Publish call, OnPublish is invoked exactly once,
//     followed by zero or more OnDeliver / OnDrop calls (one per
//     matching subscription).
//   - The relative order of OnDeliver / OnDrop calls within one Publish
//     reflects the bus's internal subscription scan and is therefore
//     implementation-defined. MemoryBus, for example, memoises the
//     match result per Subject so a hot subject sees a stable callback
//     order across publishes — observers MUST NOT rely on that order
//     being either stable or random.
//
// Observer is intentionally an interface (not a func) so a single hook
// can correlate the three lifecycle moments without ad-hoc closures.
