// signed thinking blocks, so the kernel supplies the compiler, transport,
// and decoders — this package supplies the client, the model name, and the
// capability declaration. Every MiniMax model speaks the binary-thinking
// dialect: the reasoning intent compiles to thinking: {type: "adaptive"}
// because the endpoint has no effort levels.
